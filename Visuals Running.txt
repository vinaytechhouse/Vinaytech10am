Visual:
	A skelton / component which displays data or data in graphical presentation.
Two Types of visuals
	a) Non Field Visual [ No column assignment]
		Ex:
			Image
			Textbox
			Shapes
			Buttons: Perform action based on events
	b) Field Visual [Column assigned]

		1) Data Display
			Two types
				a) Single Field Display 
					Ex: Card
				b) Multi Field Display
					Ex: Multi-Row Card, Table, Matrix
		2) Data + Graphical Display
				Two Types
				a) Simple Graphical Visuals
					Ex: KPI, Gauge etc.
				b) Complex graphical visuals
					Ex: Charts, Maps etc.
Responsive visualizations automatically adapt their size to offer a data-optimized view across different screen sizes. Thus, you can create one visualization and add it to Power BI reports and dashboards displayed on large screens and on the smallest devices.

Z-Order : This order will control visuals and over lapping.

Edit Interaction: Visuals support cross filtering, cross highlighting etc. options.
Report Creation Based on Technical Design Document [TDD]

		a) Page settings : Size, Hight, Width, Tool tip, Background etc.
		b) Page View Settings: Actual Size, FitToPage, Fit to width
		c) Theme: Common colors, fonts, sizes across report pages
		d) Visuals: Based on the business functionality we will take correct visual
		e) Concepts: Navigations, Actions, Mouse Hover etc.
		f) Mobile View : Default is Landscape view, you can convert into portait view etc.

		
Lock aspect ratio: Resizing the visual horizontal and vertical proportional.

Text wrap: If the length of the text is more automatically divided into multiple lines.

Alt Text: Narrator (screen reader) will read the the content mentioned in the textbox area.

All Visuals Common Format Properties:
		General
			a) Properties b) Alt Text c) Header Icons d) BackGround e) Title etc.

Action:
	When we click, it performs respective operation.
	a) Back: Going back to the previous page
	b) Page Navigation: Going to the respective page
	c) Bookmark: Going to therespective bookmarks
	d) QA: Opening QA dialogue box
	e) URL: Opening respective URL
	f) Drill through: Opening respective page with required visual information


QA Button action drawbacks:

	a) The result we can't save
	b) QA default button format we can't change

	Hence MS announced a QA visual [both possible], this QA visual is AI visual.


Bookmark:
	Which creates a snapshot from visual or page.
	Two types
	a) Report bookmarks: Developer created at Power BI Desktop level
	b) Personal bookmarks: User create while browsing at Power BI Service
	
	Advantages:
	a) User can create his interested areas and see all those after browsing
	b) Bookmark actions possible

Field Visuals:
	
	Data Display visuals:
		
	a) Card Visual:

			Single value placing holder
			It supports either measure or column with aggregation

	b) Multi-row card: [Row visual] : We can split into rows

			Multiple cards in a row and multiple rows in a visual.
		
			Adv:
			Categories and rows show, rows can split.
			
			Not possible things :

			Aggregated data on top / bottom
			Titles on top / bottom
			Format control [row / column] based on values

	c) Table Visual: 	[Column visual]

			a) Columnar Visual [column by column formatted visual]
			b) Support headers and aggregate values on top / bottom
			c) To show more records

			d) Row formatting, Column formatting [static, conditional]
	

			
		Conditional Formatting ways:
		a) Gradient: Low-High colors [medium applicable]
		b) Rules: Based on conditions
		c) Field Value: Based on field value formatting another field

		Disadv:
			Drill down and drill up not possible
			Row Vs Column not possible

	d) Matrix Visual: [Row Vs. Column]

			a) Cross Tab reporting visual which displays Row Vs. Column
			b) Simply
				Table + Rows+ Drilldown-Drillup+ Row and Column Grand and Sub Totals
			Disadv:
			Not for many rows [limited categories]


			--Data Display Visuals Completed-----------------

			Note: Matrix format options slightly different from table...additional features of matrix
				available in formating area inaddition to table format options



Simple Graphical Visuals:	KPI, Gauge, Bullet Chart etc.

		KPI: Key Performance Indicator

		  a) Important business values display in images, icons etc.
		  b) It talks about current value reached target or not.
		  c) We have KPI for overall business values

		Ex: Locations KPI-To see all locations Current business value Vs. Target
		     Courses KPI- To see all courses Current business value Vs. Target
		
		      Real-world:
			a) Traffic signal[red, green, yellow]
			b) Out / Not Out 
			c) Market status ...up or down arrow...

		Note: Colors, Fonts etc. controlled either static / dynamic (conditions based)

		Gauge Visual:  KPI + minimum + maxium

			   Real-world:
			a) Car, bike, bus etc. speedo meter [radial gauge of 180 degress]
			b) BP Machine, water level, milk purity machines...Linear Gauge

			Reading Visual: In the range of 5M to 25M, current business reached 22M, there is a gap to target 			and scope to maximum value.

=========================
Bullet Chart [KPI multi category visual]
=========================
It is also a KPI, but it displays multiple categories and status.
Bullet Chart: Gauge + Needs improvement + Satisfactory+ Good+ Very Good+Target1+Target2

Situation:
An organization has 10  courses, each course business status want to see...among multiple status information ...

Multiple categories and each category a status...bullet chart


====================================================
Situation:
a) I want to compare all business locations and values  [Comparing]
b) I want to see male and female distribution in each year [Contribution]
c) I want to see Sales Vs Manufacturing status [Relationship]
etc.

Multi Categories...Compare / Group / Relationship / Contribution

=====================================================

		
=============================		
Charts: 
=============================
	Charts designed for four operations.
	a) Compare: One item compared to another with value and bar
	b) Composition: Multiple items combined percentage 100 %...Invidual item percentage displayed
	c) Distribute: With in the parent child value distribution
	d) Relationships: One value relationship with another value

	Bar Charts: Bar for comparing
	Stacked: For distribution [compulsary child required]
	Clustered: For grouping [ compulsary child required]
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Stacked Bar Charts: 	Distribution and Comaprison charts :  *Parent and Child
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	a) With in parents childs distributed and compared
	b) Parents also compared

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	100% Stacked Bar: Composition Distribution Comparing: **Childs operation
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	a) With in parents childs composition, distributed and compared
	b) Parents bar lengths same

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Clustered Bar Chart: Grouping and Comparing : **Childs comparison
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	a) With in the parent childs grouped and compared
	b) Across parents childs compared


When do you go for Row or Column charts?
	Depending on the area
	More space / Less space / Portait View / Landscape View

=============
Rounded Charts:
=============
	a) Rounded charts: [ Shape in rounded format]
     		 Above bar charts do not support parent category composition.
    		1. 100% consideration of all slices / ARCs[More value big slice, less value small slice]
    		2. Easy understanding for less categories [ 5 to 6 categories appear good]
    		3. Also help us for comparing the slice values 
      		  [More size more value, Less size less value]
   		 4. These occupy less space [image area]
		5. Slices /ARCs in the order of high to low                
         
   		Example: Pie, Donut (hole with size / has inner radius) etc...
   		 Purpose:              a) Composition b) Comparison       
    
		 Composition: Percentage Comparing: Size of Slice    
		 Requirement:      One Textual (can have sub textual) and one measurable

Pie							Donut

Rounded Shape					Rounded ring shape
Composition and Comparing				Composition and Comparing
Slices based comparing				ARC based comparisons
We can’t place a visual in Pie	Donut allows visual
Pie can’t be converted to Donut with feature		Donut can be converted to pie.
						0% radius is Pie [more than zero is donut]





Trend Analysis:
		This is possible with Line chart.
		Trend: Multiple categories connecting together to analyse.

		Line: 
			Multiple points connected using line to see up, down, and stream trend
			
			Secondary y-Axis: analysing one more measure along with general y-axis
			Legend: Child value trend analysis
			Note: When we take secondary y-axis, legend is not possible.


		Area:
			a) Lines area filled with colors
			b) Color overlapping is there
			c) Actual business values and lines trend


		Stacked Area:
			a) Child values presented from low to high [top to bottom]
			b) No color pverlapping
			c) Actual business values and lines trend varies

		Line and Stacked Column:  [Mixed chart]
			
			Trend analysis on one measure + distribution and comparing on another measure

		Line and Clustered Column: [ Mixed Chart]
			
			Trend analysis on one measure + Grouping and comparing on another measure


		Ribbon Chart:
			Stacked Column + child values distributed top to bottom + child values trend covered using ribbon 

		===========
		Funnel Chart:
		===========
				a) Categories in cylinders
				b) Top to bottom analysis
				c) Majorly for stage wise analysis in an environment
				d) Always displays current value in the percent of previous and actual value

	 	===========
		Waterfall Chart
		===========
				However water flows the same way
				a)Values up and down, not trend...
				b)Mostly postive and negative values show
				Red: Loss, small bar: less loss  bigger bar: more loss
				Green: Profit  Small bar: Less profit   bigger bar: more profit

		========
		Scatter Chart
		========
				a) Multi Axis chart
				b) First chart which establishes relationship between two measures for categories
				c) Also has one more axis (called Play-Axis) to play with the presentation [filter visual]
				d) Relationship values in bubbles, hence bubble size can be controlled with another 							measure		
				
			Note: Maximum 3 measures and Maxium three categories we can take
				Measures: X-Axis, Y-Axis, Bubble Size
				Categories: Legend, Play Axis


			Ex: Demand and Supply of products you want to see in all locations
			      Manufacturing Vs Sales relationship


		Small Multiple:
				Multiple charts for the given category

		Key Influencer:
				a) AI visual [ inside algorithms will decide the process and result]								b) Displays key influencing factors for business [or any] increase / descrease
				
		Decomposition Tree:
				
				a) AI visual [ inside algorithms will decide the process and result]		
				b) If you want to see how a value generated from multiple categories and sub 							categories, it is helpful

		Smart Narrative:
	
				Gives the narrration for the visual / visuals in a page.
				So that end user will understand and progress easily.

				You can add your own values, you can modify existing, and you can link to new URLs.

		R and Python:
				
				Refer to material
				R and Python
==============================================================

R			PYTHON
Statistical Language	General purpose programming languages
Statisticians use this	Normal programming, statistics, and many more operations
Support Data Science	Support Programming, Data Science, AI, Analytics etc.


R and Python in Power BI
==============================================================
We have these languages in two places

a) Power Query: 

		a) Here to extract, transform with custom rules and protocols 
		
b) If the given transforms not sufficient, you want to perform more statistical and 

data science related calculations,	then R (statistical lang) and Python (general 

purpose very powerful lang) are used.

b) Power View level:

	        If the existing visuals not sufficient and you want to generate custom visuals using R 

and Python, then use R, Python options.

	
		Paginated Report Visual:
				Recently added to show paginated report in non paginated report page.
				Note: paginated reports extension is .rdl [SSRS / Power Bi Report Builder / Formatted 					Table report]

=============
Pre-Requisite
==============

a) Install R / Python (or Anaconda) software [mandatory], add the path in the environment variables [optional]

1st way: File menu Options and Settings R / Python Scripting and Click Install
2nd Way: Google it and Install

b) Download required Libraries or Packages, Classes and Methods [which you want to use]

c)  Ensure those environmental paths specified in the Power BI Desktop, File Menu->Options

d) Take R or Python visual on the report view, write the code in code editor, click run to 

generate the visual with data.




Paginated Report Visual:

		You want to show paginated report inside non paginated pages, this visual is helpful.
		Paginated: Splitting rows into multiple pages and also prinatble.
			  Legacy mechanism.
			 By using Power Bi Report Builder / SSRS Report Builder / SSDT we will create.
			The extension of the report is ".rdl" [Report Definition Language]

===========================================================================




		Map Visual:
			a) Geo spatial maps generation
			b) Display locations or points and their business values
			c) Controlling the locations and points with business values
			
			What we require?

			a) Longitude and lattitude [if we don't know the locations]
					Ex: You sitting positions map
					      You are flying...fly points ...
			b) Location names

		Maps:
			a) Normal Map [Bubble Map] : Initial
			b) Filled area 
			c) Shape map [2019]
			d) ARCGIS Map [2020]
			Note: MS copied the heat map partial operation in bubble map


	Bubble map:
			1. Locations or longitude and lattitude in the form of bubbles
			2. Bubble size controlled based on values [bigger bubble: more size, small bubble: less size]
			3. World map [Bing map]
			4. Supports zoom different options and also map type

	Filled Area Map:	

			1. Locations or longitude and lattitude displaed as map locations
			2. Map locations colors controlled based on values 
				[Thick color: more value, Light bubble: less size]
			3. World map [Bing map]
			4. Supports zoom different options and also map type
			5. Supports cross highlighting and filtering [edit interactions supported]
			6. Colors can be controlled either static / conditional expressions


	Shape Map: [2019]
			
			1. Locations or longitude and lattitude displayed as map locations

			3. Required area map [own shape map]
			4. Supports zoom different options and also map type
			5. Supports cross highlighting and filtering [edit interactions supported]
			6. Colors can be controlled either static / conditional expressions [more color formatting]

			Note: Few locations by default available, for your customized locations need to add JSON file
				with locations.

			If you don't shape map in the visuals list, go to file menu-->options and settings-->preview 			features-> tick mark shape map


		The below web site helps to bring Longitude and lattitude value

			https://quakesearch.geonet.org.nz/


	ARCGIS Map: 

			Power View menu options
			Many beautiful options available...let me explain...

			d)ARCGis Visual
			 [Aeronautical Reconnaissance Coverage Geographic Information System]
			  [It has many visual formatting, colors, shapes etc. features than above all]
 		
			1) Microsoft joined with ESRI [Environmental System Research Institute] organization 
				to get ArcGis maps [SSRS supporting this map]
				    Many companies asked Microsoft a Powerful mapping, 
				i.e ArcGis  ArcGis added recently.
			2) It has many layers, many options, many controls, many ways of display etc.
			3) One of the complex map and more detailed map in the mapping visuals.
			4) It was added in 2020 
			5) It has the functionality of Bullet Map + Shape Map+ Filled Map + Other Features

How to change the langauge of Power BI Desktop content and model?

File menu-->options and settings-->regional setting

Sensitivity label:

Sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection on your reports, dashboards, datasets, dataflows, and .pbix files can guard your sensitive content against unauthorized data access and leakage. Labeling your data correctly with sensitivity labels ensures that only authorized people can access your data. This article shows you how to apply sensitivity labels in the Power BI service and in Power BI Desktop.


Diff between lock object and lock aspect?
lock object does not support moving the object, whereas lock aspect talks abot resize of a visual.

When you highlight a visual, you will get two additional menus.
a) Format b)Data / Drill

When you highlight a Field, you will get two more additional menus.
a) Column tools b) Table Tools

Bring to front--> All layers front
Bring forward--> One layer forward

Send to back--> All layers back
Send backward-> One layer back


A visual processing:
	Visual internal process:
		a) DAX query generated
		b) DAX query hit on dataset and brings data
		c) Places data on skelton
		d) Visual data formatting [static and conditional]

		Total visual time= a+b+c+d

Visual Table:
		Visual level data display table information
DataPoint Table:     A particular data point level data information

		===================================
		User interaction in the report and visuals communication
		===================================
		There are multiple ways of visuals communication / user interactive communication
		a) Edit interactions
			We can control how you can show other visual when you browse / slice current visual.
			Three options
			1. CrossFilter  2.CrossHighlight 3. None

		b) Parameters at Power Query
			Little old mechanism available at Power Query, not fully user fiendly at visuals.
			Note: Used for environment connections [Dev settings, Test settings, Prod settins etc.]
				 in the projects.

		c) Slicers
			What? An user interactive visual
			How it appears? Multiple ways
					a) List : Checkbox items : Numbers, Text, Date etc.
					b) Drowdown: Number, Text, Date etc.
					c) Between and : Numbers and Dates
					d) Less than or equal to: Numbers
					e) Greater than or equal to: Numbers
					f)  Is After: Dates
					g) Is Before: Dates

			Orientation:
					Horizontal: Appear like buttons  [ recently added inspred from Chicklet slicer]
					Vertical: As a list of values

			Fields?
					Till 2021, only one field.
					Now, it supports multiple fields and hierarchies [inspired from hierarchy slicer]
			Sync Slicer?
					Common slicing between multiple pages [may be all / required]



			When do we go for List option?
					Less values
			When do we go for Dropdown / Between and other options?
					More values
			What are the recently added features to slicer?
					a) Hierarchy  b) Button slicing

				
		d) Filters
			
			Manual static option specified at filter pane.
			Four types of filters
			a) Visual Filter: Only visual filtered. It has filter options TOP N, Advanced, Basic
			b) Page Filter: All visuals in the page filtered: It has filter options Advanced, Basic
			c)  Report Filter: All pages in the report filter: It has filter options Advanced, Basic
			d) Drillthrough filter:
				Two types
				a) Single report drill through: One page to another page in the same report
				b) CrossReport drill through: One page in one report to another page in another report
		
			Which page we usually consider  drill through page?
				The page which acts like child / detailed data

			What happens when we consider a page as drill through?
				System takes back button on the page. 

			Differences between sync slicer and report filter?

				Sync slicer: a) Filtering may be required / all pages b) It has no options
				Report Filter: a) Filtering all pages  b) It has options [ Basic, Advanced]

			Why Page and Report do not have 'Top N' option?

				In a page we may have single value visuals, in this situation TOP N does not work.
				Hence, scientists restricted to visual only.
				Ex: Card, KPI etc...they do not support multiple values...hence no TOP N

			Differences between filter and slicer?
			Slicer					Filter
			-----					-------
			User interactive visual			Not a visual
			Display options available[List, Dropdown etc.]	No display options [only pane level]
			Sync Slicing possible on required pages		Not possible [report all visuals sync possible]
			

		c) What-if parameters

			It has slicer + parameter mechansim

			Why added?
				To provide user interaction using slicer visual + manual entering of values

			Adv:
				Above point + manual entered value / slicer value we can store and use in other areas.
				[Note: That area is parameter area]

			Concept:

			User enter / selected value-->Parameter--> Visual / Calculation

		Example:
		Calculation based on the user input "year"
		Total DF based on user sel year=CALCULATE(sum(FactPayments[Discount_Fee]),filter(DimDate,DimDate				[Year]=paryear[paryear Value]))
		==================================================================



	Performance Analyzer:

		Added in 2021 to see visuals performance in  a page.
		How each visual is running with internal process and time taking.
		
		Visual internal process:

		a) DAX query generated
		b) DAX query hit on dataset and brings data
		c) Places data on skelton
		d) Visual data formatting [static and conditional]

		Total visual time= a+b+c+d
		
		Adv:
		a) You can see the process
		b) If there is a time delay or more time, you can identify and optimize the area.

		a) DAX query optimization:
			Take the query to the DAX studio (or any), generate plan, see the plan and take action 
			accordingly.
		b) Format optimization
			Remove unnecessary conditional formatting and other custom expression options
